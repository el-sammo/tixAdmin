--------------------------------------------------------------

Using jQuery File Upload (UI version) with Node.js

You can install the sample Node.js upload service on your server via npm:

npm install blueimp-file-upload-node
You can start the service by running the following command:

./node_modules/blueimp-file-upload-node/server.js

Next, download the plugin archive, extract it, and adjust the url option in main.js to the url of your Node.js service (e.g. "http://localhost:8080").
You can then upload the project folder (without the unnecessary server subfolder) to any static file server and use it as interface to your Node.js upload service.

Make sure to have imagemagick CLI tools installed on the server running the node upload service.
